## Introduction
Fantasy Football is a multi-billion dollar industry with millions of users. By leveraging advanced NFL statistics, this project aims to provide users with an edge in Fantasy Football by analyzing player performance metrics and trends.

## Research Questions
1. How much does volume matter in Fantasy Football?
2. How volatile are top-end wide receivers (WRs)?
3. How volatile are top-end quarterbacks (QBs)?
4. What are some underlying features of top-tier WRs?
5. Does a heavy workload for running backs (RBs) account for injuries in the season or following seasons?
